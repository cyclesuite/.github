## Types
Please see the categories below for information on contributing to the specific categories.

### Code
We welcome code contributions for features and bugs that have been placed in our roadmap. We want to make sure no one wastes their time, so please talk to maintainers before contributing to understand what would be accepted.

> See [roadmap](#roadmap) for more information.

<!--
	You should not edit this portion unless
	given explicit permission by a maintainer.

### Vulnerabilities
If you find a vulnerability, we ask that you contact us with information reguarding the vulnerability. Such information shall answer:

* How was the vulnerability was discovered?
* What is the potentional impact of the vulnerability?
* How can the vulnerability can be exploited?

If you think you can solve a vulnerability, please follow the guidelines located below.

* While testing, take measures to avoid affecting other users' experiences. If possible, you should test in your own experience.
* Please keep testing on an alternate account, generally, this account should be disclosed to us beforehand.
* Take measures to avoid disclosing vulnerabilities to others without explicitly receiving permission from a maintainer before a fix has been released. Whenever possible, we will disclose the vulnerability, solution, and contributors, once fixed.
* If you are aware that your testing may harm the reliability or integrity of our services, stop immediately and contact us.
* Do not attempt non-technical testing, such as social engineering our employees or users.

> *These instructions can also be found in our [security policy](https://github.com/cyclesuite/Cycle/security/policy). You should visit such to learn more.*

### Documentation
Documentation has much more of an impact than just lines of code. If you find any problem in our documentation, such as typos, bad grammar, misleading phrasing, or missing content, feel free to file issues and pull requests to fix them.

## Roadmap
While we enjoy adding things people enjoy, we ask that you only add features that are already approved in our roadmap. In most cases, our own developers will add these features, since they may need to be implemented in a certain way. This is why it's important to contact a maintainer before adding a **significant** feature. It's alright to fix a bug report or add a small feature that is not in the roadmap, without needing to contact a maintainer, either. In cases that you are adding a small feature, you should create an issue or talk with the community to ensure that it is the best choice - maintainers are busy, so this may cut down on the amount of time it takes to implement.
